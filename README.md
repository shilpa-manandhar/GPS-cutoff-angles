The GPS and Weather station data from singpaore which has been used for the paper are also made available.

## Manuscript
The author version of this manuscript is Manuscript.PDF.

## Code Organization
All codes are written in MATLAB. 

## Dataset
The dataset used in this manuscript is GPS PWV data derived using GIPSY/OASIS II software using RINEX files for IGS stations and SiReNT GPS stations from Singapore. The data files also consist of the weather station data. Weather station is collocated to the GPS station.
